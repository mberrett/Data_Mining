Instructions for running homework code
#######################################
by Matias Berretta Magarinos

Hello! Ideally I would like for my code to be run on Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).
But just in case there’s a problem, I also included normal python versions of the code (.py).

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN CODE:

1st Choice: Jupyter Notebook (HW1.ipynb)
 - Open terminal
 - Set directory as folder with homework files
 - Write "Jupyter Notebook" into terminal and press enter to open Jupyter
 - Open the HW1-Q1.ipynb file
 - Run code:
   o Run each cell by pressing shift enter 
   o On the tool bar click "Cell" and choose "Run All"
 - Repeat process for HW1-Q2.ipynb and HW1-Q3.ipynb

2nd Choice: regular Python file (HW1.py)
  - Open terminal
  - Set directory as folder containing HW files (csv, ipynb, and py files)
  - Run HW1-Stream.py 
    o Write “python HW1-Q1.py” and press Enter
    o Make sure you’re running python 3
 - Repeat process for HW1-Q2.py and HW1-Q3.py


WRITTEN ANSWERS AND PLOTS:

 - Open Folders for Q1,Q2,Q3
 - Both written answers and plots should be in those folders


RESOURCES: 

Resources I used to besides lecture slides to answer these questions:
 — “Learning from Data” by Yaser S. Abu Mostafa, etc.
 — “An Introduction to Statistical Learning” by Gareth James, etc.
