INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN CODE FOR Q1:

Jupyter Notebook (HW2.ipynb)
 - Open terminal
 - Set directory as folder with homework files
 - Write "Jupyter Notebook" into terminal and press enter to open Jupyter
 - Open the HW2-Q1.ipynb file
 - Run code:
   o On the tool bar click "Cell" and choose "Run All"   
   o Alternatively, run each individual cell by pressing shift enter 
   

WRITTEN AND VISUAL ANSWERS:

 - Open Folder “Answers & Instructions” to find Folders Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4
 - All written answers and visuals (Excel files, PDF files, Weka screenshots) 
   should be found in these folders or in folders contained within these folders. 

SPECIFICS

 - Part of the answers for Q1 and Q3 are in text file format.
 - However there are two screenshots for Q1 to demonstrate the output 
   without having to run the code 
 - The answer for Q2 is in screenshot image format
   Please be aware that there are two screenshots: 
   “Q2_Unpruned_Tree” and “Q2_Pruned_Tree”
   However the excel versions can be found in the folder as well
 - The answer for Q4 is in PDF format (written with LaTeX, a document preparation system).

 - The work for Q1 is shown in “HW2_Q1.ipynb”
 - The work for Q2 is shown in “Q2_Work.xslx”
 - The work for Q3 is shown in screenshots for each of the 5 runs of SVM on Weka.
 - The work for Q4 is shown in the PDF proof itself.

Resources I used to besides lecture slides to answer these questions:
 — “Learning from Data” by Yaser S. Abu Mostafa, etc.
 — “An Introduction to Statistical Learning” by Gareth James, etc.
